# 🏅 Olympic Medal Data Analysis

A data analysis project that explores historical Olympic medal data to uncover patterns, trends, and insights across countries, sports, and years using Python and data science tools.

---

## 📌 Project Objective

This project analyzes Olympic medal datasets to answer questions such as:

* Which countries dominate the Olympics over time?
* How medal distribution changes across years
* Which sports contribute the most medals
* Performance comparison between countries
* Trends in gold, silver, and bronze medals
* Athlete and sport-level insights

The goal is to apply **data analysis, visualization, and exploratory techniques** to extract meaningful insights from real-world historical data.
